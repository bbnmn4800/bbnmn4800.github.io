This is a simple web project that consists of one CSS file, one JavaScript file, and multiple HTML files. The CSS and JavaScript files are shared across all HTML files to maintain consistency in style and functionality.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `css/styles.css`: Contains all the CSS styles for the project.
- `js/script.js`: Contains all the JavaScript code for the project.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file of the project.
- `about.html`: The HTML file for the about page.
- `contact.html`: The HTML file for the contact page.
- `README.md`: The documentation for the project.
